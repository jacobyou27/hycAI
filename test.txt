Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly, procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. Python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.

The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. PyPI helps you find and install software developed and shared by the Python community.

# Variables and Data Types
Python variables do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space. The declaration happens automatically when a value is assigned to a variable. The equal sign (=) is used to assign values to variables. The operand to the left of the = operator is the name of the variable, and the operand to the right is the value stored in the variable.

For example:
x = 5
y = "John"
