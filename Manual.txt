# Maintenance and Care

### Usage Environment
- **Vibration Resistance**: If the image measuring instrument is subjected to additional surrounding vibrations, the measurement accuracy will decrease. When the frequency is less than 10Hz, the amplitude of the surrounding vibration should not exceed 2μm (peak-to-peak value); when the frequency is between 10Hz and 50Hz, the acceleration should not exceed 0.4Gal. If the vibration exceeds these limits, vibration isolation measures should be taken (such as installing vibration dampers).
- **Dust-Free**: The components of the image measuring instrument must be kept dust-free. Although the dust cover has a certain protective effect on the image measuring instrument, the instrument should still be cleaned regularly.
- **Power Supply**: Use a stable power supply of 90-264VAC, 47-63Hz, 10Amp to ensure the normal operation of the instrument.
- **Temperature**: The ambient temperature should be kept at 20°C±1°C as much as possible. Do not adjust the machine accuracy at high or low temperatures; otherwise, the measurement accuracy at 20°C cannot be ensured.
- **Humidity**: Humidity does not directly adversely affect measurement accuracy. However, high humidity can cause rust on the mechanical surface and hinder smooth axial movement. Therefore, the ambient humidity should be kept between 30% and 80%.
- **Lighting**: The image measuring instrument should not be placed in strong light or direct sunlight, as this will greatly affect the measurement accuracy.

### Component Maintenance
- **Measurement Platform**: Be particularly careful with the glass platform when loading and unloading workpieces. Sometimes the measurement platform will have water vapor and oil mist; use a cleaner to remove dirt.
- **Body Shell**: When the image measuring instrument is not in use, cover it with a dust cover. If the body shell is contaminated, wipe it with a soft cloth. Although contamination of the body shell does not directly affect measurement accuracy, it may spread to other parts of the body, such as linear guides or platforms, which do affect measurement accuracy.

## 3.4 Establishing Tasks

### 3.4.1 Establishing Tasks through Manual Measurement
The basic steps for establishing tasks through manual measurement are similar to the measurement steps in 3.3, with the following differences:
- Set the workpiece coordinate system, the task starts automatic measurement from the first set workpiece coordinate system, the elements before the first coordinate system need to be measured manually.
- Insert empty operations to plan the measurement path of the machine.
- Insert text prompts in some steps to remind the user of the operation.
- Edit and modify tasks, modify or delete elements in the task, and set tolerances. See 4.2.7 "Task Menu" for detailed instructions.
- Set the focus mode of element measurement, used for automatic focusing before measurement during the automatic task running process.
- Set the element properties to "manual elements", and the program will pause during the automatic task running process and wait for the user to measure manually. After completion, it will enter the automatic running process again.
- Save the task: save the current task as a file with the .tsk suffix to complete the task generation.

### 3.4.2 Importing Tasks from DXF Drawings

1. Open the drawing file.
   - Execute the menu item "Task -> Open DXF Drawing", select and open a DXF drawing. It is recommended to use AutoCAD 2004 or above version drawings. When opening drawings below AutoCAD 2004 version, a prompt box will pop up.

2. Select the layer to extract.
   - After opening the drawing, select the option box of the specific layer in the "Layer Information List" in the pop-up window to extract the corresponding layer information.

3. Delete and restore elements.
   - If the extracted layer information includes unnecessary elements, select the elements to be deleted in the "Retain Elements" list and click the "Delete" button. The element will be moved to the "Deleted Elements" list. If it needs to be restored later, select the element in the "Deleted Elements" list and click the "Restore" button. After deleting unnecessary elements, only the retained element pattern will be displayed on the left side of the window.

4. Scaling ratio.
   - The ratio of the actual part value to the drawing value. For example, if a 1mm line segment in the drawing is 2mm in the actual part, the scaling ratio is 2. The default scaling ratio is 1.

5. Element filtering.
   - In the opened editing standard drawing interface, after clicking the element filtering option, the types of elements that can be filtered will be displayed. Elements can be filtered according to needs. Element filtering has three states. Clicking on it with the mouse will respectively show: "check" means the selected element type is displayed and measured, "blank" means this type of element is not displayed and not measured, and "square" means the selected element is displayed but not measured. The "Hide elements without annotation" operation is also the same as the three states in the element filtering. Note: Elements and annotations need to be associated in CAD to be effective. After completing the element filtering operation, click "Refresh", and the drawing display will be refreshed. Click "Clear All", and no elements will be displayed or measured. At this time, "Clear All" becomes "Select All". Click "Select All" and all elements will be displayed and measured.

6. Set the reference coordinate system and work light source.
   - To enable the software to automatically measure the loaded elements, a workpiece coordinate system must be established for the task to run and establish a corresponding relationship with the actual part. At the same time, set the appropriate light source for part measurement.

### 3.4.3 Importing Measurement from Gerber Drawings

1. Open the Gerber drawing.
   - Execute the menu item "Task -> Open Gerber Drawing", select the corresponding drawing to open.

2. Edit the Gerber drawing.
   - The editing of the Gerber drawing is basically the same as the DXF drawing, except there is no element filtering option.

---

## 3.5 Batch Automatic Measurement

- When multiple samples of the same model workpiece need to be batch tested, use this fully automatic batch detection method.
- First, establish a measurement task, then run this task to perform batch measurements on other workpieces.

### Operation Steps
- Generate task: The operation steps for generating a task file are detailed in 3.4 "Establishing Tasks".
- Load task: Load a task from the task file, or directly use the task just established.
- Set the workpiece coordinate system: Except for the first element which is

 the fixture coordinate system and does not need to be manually extracted, other elements need the user to manually extract and set the first coordinate system. The program automatically aligns the workpiece and the measurement drawing according to the coordinate system manually extracted by the user and performs automatic measurement.
- Set tolerance data according to measurement accuracy requirements.
- Set the task measurement loop times according to actual measurement needs.
- Set output: After automatic measurement, the software will automatically generate a .rst data file, which can be opened by SPC. If the user needs to directly output data, it can be set through the task parameter output file and the output settings item in the right-click menu of the element.
- Click to run the task: After running the task, the measurement software will automatically control the machine and lens to measure all elements and related characteristic values in the task list in sequence.

### 4.5.4 Coordinate

#### Coordinate Function
The coordinate function can establish different coordinate systems, and multiple coordinate systems can be established in one task. Existing coordinate systems can also be adjusted.

Coordinate system functions belong to construction functions. Therefore, before establishing a coordinate system, the base elements of the coordinate system need to be generated. **Note:** Due to the construction principle of the coordinate system, some special cases of constructing coordinate systems will be unstable. For example, when determining a coordinate system with a point and a line, if the line segment is in a 90-degree vertical state, the construction will be unstable. Also, when determining a coordinate system with two lines, using a line segment and its bisector to construct will also be unstable. Please use it accordingly.

The VMQ main window has two modes: video image mode and drawing measurement mode. The drawing measurement mode is similar to the standard Vispec software. Refer to section 4.4.

The VMQ video image mode differs from the standard Vispec video area, described in detail below:

Due to the large field-of-view lens used in VMQ, the entire platform image can be seen. Key points include:
- **Yellow Line**: The yellow line is the measurement area warning line. The area inside the yellow line is the measurement area, ensuring measurement accuracy. Outside the yellow line, measurement accuracy is not guaranteed.
- **Image Zoom**: Click the video area and scroll the mouse wheel to zoom in and out. Adjust the object platform height to improve image clarity if needed.
- **Image Move**: Click the video area and drag the mouse wheel to move the image.

### 9.6 VMQ Light Source Control Area
The VMQ software does not have a grating and operation control area, but the light source control area is similar to the standard Vispec software. Refer to section 4.6.3.

The main difference in the VMQ light source control area is the addition of "Adjust CCD Exposure Time".

The default exposure time value is around 20. Generally, when using surface light, adjust the exposure time to enhance the effect. The default value is sufficient when using contour light.

### Chapter 10: Software Enhancement Function Description
This chapter details the enhanced functions of the Vispec software, i.e., the items in the "Tools" dropdown menu.

#### 10.1 SPC
Every time a measurement task runs normally, the Vispec software saves the measurement data as a data file (.rst). SPC can perform statistical analysis on these saved data.

1. **Load Sample Data**:
  - Load Sample: Select the directory where the measurement data is located and choose the data files to view by multi-selection.
  - Clear Sample: To perform new SPC analysis, clear the already loaded sample data first. Otherwise, the original sample data will remain when new samples are loaded.

2. **Control Items**:
  Click any element in the left element list, and the right side shows the attribute data of the element in each file. Double-click on the control attribute column to open the "Set Control Items" dialog box. Right-click to open a menu and select "Add to Control Items" to open the "Set Control Items" dialog box.

  In the "Set Control Items" dialog box, set the standard value and tolerance. After setting, click confirm to complete a control item setup. The attributes and statistical results of all the elements will be displayed in the charts and data pages. Switch the current control item through the control item dropdown box when there are multiple control items.

3. **Control Chart**:
  Click "Control Chart" to view various control charts of the current control item, as shown below:

- **XBar-R**: When quality data can be reasonably grouped, use the X control chart for the process average and the R control chart for process variation.
- **XBar-S**: Similar to X-R control chart, but the S control chart has higher detection power though it's more complex to calculate. Generally, use the R control chart for sample size n < 10 and the S control chart for n > 10.
- **XMed-R**: Similar to X-R control chart, but the X control chart has weaker detection power. It's simpler to calculate.
- **X-RM**: Use the X-RM control chart when quality data cannot be reasonably grouped, such as:
  - Only one data can be collected at a time, such as production efficiency and loss rate.
  - Extremely uniform process quality, such as liquid concentration.
  - Time-consuming and costly to obtain measurement values, such as complex chemical analysis and destructive testing.
  Use X-R control chart to improve detection power when quality data can be reasonably grouped.

- **Histogram**: Clearly displays the distribution trend of stored data, understanding the quality status.
- **Process Control Chart**: Analyzes data distribution using the normal distribution principle, visually showing quality and comprehensive product capability.

4. **Analyze Data**: Calculates common process indicators such as Ca, Cp, and CpK, mean value, standard value, data count, defective count, and its percentage.

5. **Detailed Data**: Click "Detailed Data" to view specific data, shown below:

- Data is grouped every 5 and shows the mean and R values for each group.

6. **Toolbar Icons**:
- Exit the SPC interface.
- Export to Excel: Generates the SPC report of the current control item.
- SPC Export Settings: Sets the attributes of elements to be exported.
- Export Data to Excel: Exports all sample data set for output to Excel format for use by other software.

#### 10.5 Automatic Contour Extraction
The measurement software automatically extracts the contour of the workpiece, obtaining all points on the same contour to get the contour map of the workpiece. Click twice on the contour to set the start and end points. The software controls the platform to extract edge points along the fixed direction from the start point to the end point. Double-clicking on the contour will automatically extract all points on the contour. Successful extraction saves all edge points as a point cloud in the task list. 

For example, the main window shows the image of a small gear part. Using the automatic contour extraction function, the right platform navigation area displays the contour drawing of the part.

#### 10.6 Show Edge Map
Displays the edge strength map obtained after edge scanning of the current image. The higher the edge strength, the more accurate the extraction. The following image shows the edge strength map of a precision part.

1. **Using Equidistant Circles**:
  Replace the Calib.data file in the root directory with one that matches the machine.

2. **Parameter Settings**:

3. **User Operation**:

1) Get Image: Captures the current image area.
2) Process: Processes the ring based on the parameter settings. After each successful process, capture the image again for further processing.
3) Load Image: Imports an existing image.
4) Save Image: Saves the processed image.
5) Export Data: Saves the processed data to Excel.

4. **Large Image Processing**:
When the product exceeds a single view, use the "Panorama Scan" function to scan and save the image. Then import the image for equidistant processing.

#### 10.7 Drawing Comparison
Compares the measurement drawing of the workpiece with the original

 drawing, calculating contour deviations and completing the contour comparison of the workpiece.

- **Contour Deviation**: abs(max(abs(max inner deviation), abs(max outer deviation))) x 2.
- **Maximum Deviation Pixel**: When the measurement drawing is aligned with the standard drawing, points on the measurement drawing with vertical distances exceeding the maximum deviation pixel are not calculated, excluding noise.

#### 10.8 Sieve Calibration
Clears all data in the sieve module and the main interface task list.
- **Get Sampling Location**: Sets the sampling location for sieve detection. Calibration standards require two sampling locations. The software allows multiple locations, sequentially sampling horizontally and vertically.
- **Delete Sampling Location**: Deletes the selected sampling location.
- **Start Detection**: Detects based on the set sampling locations, horizontally and vertically for each location. The status bar shows detection progress. If mesh standard dimensions are set, the software calculates and summarizes sieve detection data.
- **Stop Detection**: Terminates the sieve detection process.
- **Data Statistics**: Calculates and summarizes detected sieve data. Displays average wire diameter, average mesh size deviation, and maximum mesh size deviation after setting the mesh standard dimensions.
- **Export Data**: Exports sieve detection data to a preset Excel report. The default template is sieving.xlt.

**Steps**:
1. Focus the image clearly.
2. Open the sieve function.
3. Extract an element (e.g., line segment) at the sampling location.
4. Click "Get Sampling Location". Up to 5 locations can be sampled.
5. Enter mesh count, click start detection, and wait for successful detection.
6. Click "Export Data", choose the output path, and open the output file.

### Chapter 11: Measurement Examples
The main applications of image measuring instruments can be divided into reverse engineering and workpiece measurement. This chapter details the Vispec software (including VMQ software) operation process through practical measurement steps.

#### 11.1 Mobile Phone Shell Reverse Engineering (Reverse Engineering)
The VM series image measuring instruments facilitate reverse engineering to obtain geometric information of the workpiece, exporting to DXF files. Other CAD software can construct complete workpiece data. This example completes the reverse engineering task of a mobile phone shell.

1. Turn on the power of the control cabinet and wait for the machine to complete self-check.
2. Turn on the computer and double-click the Vispec software icon on the desktop.
3. Place the workpiece on the measurement work platform.
4. Turn on the lower light source and adjust the brightness to a suitable level.
5. Reduce the lens magnification to the minimum.
6. Move the XY platform to bring the mobile phone shell into the visible range.
7. Move the Z-axis to focus clearly on the mobile phone shell. Use the autofocus function if necessary.
8. For clear, large contours, use "Auto Contour Tracking" to automatically extract contour points.
9. For small, regular contours, use extraction and drawing tools to extract elements.
10. Use annotation tools to mark necessary data.
11. Use construction tools to generate new elements from existing elements.
12. Adjust the current coordinate system as needed using coordinate tools.
13. After drawing all elements, use "Output DXF" to export the drawing to a DXF file.

#### 11.2 PCB Inspection
The VM series image measuring instruments enable efficient workpiece measurement. For batch detection, create a measurement task, then use it for fast automatic measurement. This example introduces creating and running a measurement task.

**11.2.1 Create Measurement Task from Sample**
1. Place a PCB on the measurement platform and secure it with clay.
2. Move the PCB into the visible range using platform control buttons. Adjust Z-axis height and contour light intensity until the image is clear.
3. Establish the workpiece coordinate system using the "Two Points to Determine X-axis" tool. Move the platform to the lower-left round hole of the PCB, extract the first circle using "Multi-segment Extraction Circle", move to the lower-right round hole, extract the second circle similarly. Select "Two Points to Determine X-axis", setting the first circle as the origin and the direction from the first to the second circle as the X-axis to establish the coordinate system.
4. Measure necessary elements using measurement tools and annotate them.
5. Adjust the measurement order in the "Element List" by changing the insertion point.
6. Modify extraction information to adjust the element extraction process. Set elements as "manual elements" for manual extraction during task runs.
7. Save the task by clicking "Save Task", specifying the path and file name for future use.

**11.2.2 Automatic Measurement**
1. Place another PCB of the same model on the measurement platform and secure it with clay.
2. Click "Open Task" and select the task file created previously.
3. Set the task loop run count as needed.
4. Click "Run Task". If the first element is a coordinate system, the task runs automatically; otherwise, manually measure elements before the first coordinate system.
5. Manually create the workpiece coordinate system if the first element is an extracted coordinate system. Use the same method as during task creation. Click the "Center of Two Circles to Determine Coordinate System" icon, move the platform to the lower-left round hole of the PCB, extract the first circle using "Overall Extraction Circle", move to the lower-right round hole, extract the second circle similarly. Right-click after extracting the second circle, the task starts running automatically, sequentially measuring elements in the task list.
6. For manually extracted elements, the task pauses, waiting for user operation. Extract the element manually, then click "Run Task" to continue automatic running.

#### 11.3 SPC Analysis
1. Click the "SPC" icon on the main toolbar to open the SPC main interface.
2. Click "Load Sample", select the Output directory, open the "2008-5-17" subdirectory, and select data files.
3. Double-click the data item to control in the right data column to open the "Set Control Items" dialog box.
4. Enter the standard value and tolerance range.
5. Repeat steps 3-4 to add multiple control items.
6. Switch to "Control Chart" to view various control charts.

#### 11.4 VMQ Quick Matching Measurement
VMQ is ideal for batch measurement of small parts such as mobile phone accessories, gears, springs, and screws, offering fast speed and simple operation. For complex workpieces, one click achieves quick measurement, greatly improving efficiency. This example measures several similarly shaped parts.

1. Click the register pattern icon in the software main menu bar. A light blue box appears in the image area. Adjust the box size and position with the mouse.
2. Adjust the blue box to enclose a closed contour. The box turns green upon successful pattern registration, displaying the pattern number. Registered patterns are shown in the pattern display area below.
3. Extract or construct elements to measure on the registered pattern (similar to regular extraction). Click "Run" and set the maximum match count in the image matching position in task loop

 settings (default is 12, set more than or equal to the number of parts to match).
4. Run the task after setting the match count. The software matches workpieces based on the registered pattern contour and quickly measures the extracted elements. Save the matching task or set loop run count.
5. The matching process during task run is shown below:
6. If no suitable image is found, a "registration failed" prompt appears. Investigate the cause of failure, remove obstacles, and continue matching.

### Chapter 12: Common Issues

1. **Software Cannot Start**:
  - Is the operating system Microsoft® Windows® XP or Windows® 7 with SP2 installed?
  - Check if .NetFramework® 2.0 is installed since the software is built on the .Net® framework.
  - Is the image card installed in the computer?
  - Is the computer connected to the machine and is the machine powered on?

2. **Software Prompts "Image Card Not Found" at Startup**:
  - The image card is not installed. Insert the image card correctly into the computer's PCI slot.
  - The image card driver is not installed or is damaged. Reinstall the driver.
  - The image card and driver are incompatible. Install the correct driver.
  - The image card is damaged.

3. **Software Prompts "Application Failed to Start! TZTEK Image Measuring Instrument Initialization Failed" at Startup**:
  - The USB cable is not connected or has poor contact.
  - The VM image measuring instrument is not powered on, or is still in self-check.
  - The VM image measuring instrument driver is not correctly installed or is damaged.
  - The computer's USB port is damaged.

4. **No Image Display**:
  - Check if the software interface is set correctly. Ensure image acquisition is enabled, and the video image window is active.
  - Ensure the video cable is securely connected.
